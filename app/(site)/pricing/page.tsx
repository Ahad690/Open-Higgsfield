    q: "What are credits?",
    a: (
      <>
        Credits are how you pay for generations on {BRAND.name}. One balance
        covers every image and video model, and the Generate button always shows
        exactly how many credits a run will cost before you press it.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How is each generation priced?",
    a: (
      <>
        Every model has its own rate. Images are priced per image, and options
        like quality or resolution can change the price. Video is priced by the
        length of the clip, so longer shots cost more, and higher resolutions or
        native sound can add to it. Change a setting and the price on the
        Generate button updates straight away.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Do unused credits roll over?",
    a: (
      <>
        Plan credits refill at every monthly renewal: your plan balance is reset
        to the monthly allowance, so unused plan credits don&apos;t carry over.
        Annual plans refill monthly too. Top-up credits are different: they
        never expire, and we only spend them once your plan credits run out.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if a generation fails or gets blocked?",
    a: (
      <>
        You get the credits back automatically. If a run fails, is canceled, or
        is stopped by our content filter, its full cost returns to your balance.
        No support ticket needed.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cancel any time?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. Cancel from Account → Billing and your plan stays active until the
        end of the period you&apos;ve paid for, so you can keep using its
        credits until then. Top-up credits stay in your account after you
        cancel.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use what I make commercially?",
    a: (
      <>
        Paid plans include commercial use of your generations: ads, client work,
        products and channels. The Free plan is for personal projects. On any
        plan you&apos;re responsible for the prompts and references you upload.

    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How do parallel generations work?",
    a: (
      <>
        Each plan can run a set number of generations at the same time.{" "}
        {plus.name}, for example, runs {plus.concurrency.video} videos and{" "}
        {plus.concurrency.image} images at once. When you reach the limit, wait
        for one to finish before starting the next. Waiting never costs anything
        extra.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a subscription to start?",
    a: (
      <>
        No. Create a free account to explore every model, then buy a top-up pack
        whenever you need credits. Subscribe when you create often enough for
        the monthly credits and extras to pay off.
